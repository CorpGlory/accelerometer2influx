# Accelerometer2Influx

This is an Android application that takes the x-y-z axis metrics from your phone accelerometer and then sends this data to your InfluxDB. 

To get started simply provide your influxDB `address`, `login`, `password` and `database name` in corresponding fields.

Shake your phone to see different changes in timeseries data in your database.
