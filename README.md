This is an Android application that takes the x-y-z axis metrics from your phone accelerometer and then sends this data to your InfluxDB. 

First, [download](https://github.com/CorpGlory/accelerometer2influx/releases) .apk file and install to your device. Then provide your InfluxDB `address`, `login`, `password` and `database name` in corresponding fields.

Shake your phone to see different changes in timeseries data in your database.
