# Accelerometer2Influx

This is an application that takes the x-y-z axis metrics from your Android phone accelerometer and then sends this data to your influxDB.

To get started simply provide your influxDB address, login, password and database name in corresponding fields.

Shake your phone to see different changes in timeseries data in your database.
